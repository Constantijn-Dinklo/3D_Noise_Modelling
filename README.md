*the abstract from your report*

*link to your report once it is uploaded to the TU Delft repository https://repository.tudelft.nl *

This repository is for the 3D Noise Modelling Synthesis Project of the course GEO1011 at the MSc Geomatics program at the Delft Unversity of Technology.

This project is part of the research on [automated reconstruction of 3D input data for noise studies](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/projects/noise3d/) at the 3D geoinformation research group of Delft Unversity of Technology.

## Installation

*how to install the software, on which platform*

## Usage

To create xml files for each path from source to receiver the main.py program is run.

To run the program the following command can be ran on the command line:

python main.py [constrained_tin] [semantics] [receivers] [sources] [output_folder]

Where:

constrained_tin = the file path to the constrained tin, this should be a 'objp' file type

semantics = the file path to the semantics, these are the buildings and ground types of the area

receivers = the file path to the receiver points

sources = the file path to the sources that generate noise, this should be a 'gml' file type

output_folder = this is the folder where the files will be outputted

### Generating an OBJP file

Since the objp file format is a new file format we provide a way to generate it. Currently only cityjson to objp is supported.

To create an objp file a program is provided, the create_objp.py file. To run the program run the following command:

python create_objp.py [input_file] [output_folder]

Where:

input_file = The file which is used as input to create the objp file. Currently only a cityjson file in which every boundary is a triangle can be used.

output_folder = The folder where the constrained tin objp file will be placed.

### Generating noise levels

Of course the final result should be something where every receiver has a noise level associated with it. To generate this you run the test_cnossos.sh script in the following manner:

./test_cnossos.sh [test_cnossos_release] [code_file_path] [xml_input_path] [xml_output_path] [receiver_dict] [receiver_shape_file]

Where:

test_cnossos_release = The file path to the test_cnossos release folder.

code_file_path = The path to where the python code noise_maps.py is located. This will generally be in the same folder as the test_cnossos.sh file and can thus the input can be '.'.

xml_input_path = The path to the folder of all the xml files printed by the main.py program.

xml_output_path = The path to the folder where the output of each xml file should go.

receiver_dict = The path to the file which maps receiver id to coordinates. This is generated by the main.py program and will be located in the output_folder with the name 'receiver_dict.txt'.

receiver_shape_file = The path to the file where the receivers with their noise value will be stored as a shapefile.

### Complete Pipeline

While the main.py program runs the main algorithm, there are multiple steps to the entire pipeline. We provide a way to run the entire timeline in one (1) command:

./complete.sh [input_file] [objp_output_folder] [semantics] [receivers] [sources] [output_folder] [test_cnossos_release] [code_file_path] [receiver_shape_file]

Where:

input_file = The file which is used as input to create the objp file. Currently only a cityjson file in which every boundary is a triangle can be used.

objp_output_folder = The folder where the constrained tin objp file will be placed.

semantics = The file path to the semantics, these are the buildings and ground types of the area

receivers = The file path to the receiver points

sources = The file path to the sources that generate noise, this should be a 'gml' file type

output_folder = This is the folder where the files will be outputted

test_cnossos_release = The file path to the test_cnossos release folder.

code_file_path = The path to where the python code noise_maps.py is located. This will generally be in the same folder as the test_cnossos.sh file and can thus the input can be '.'.

receiver_shape_file = The path to the file where the receivers with their noise value will be stored as a shapefile.

## Limitations

*what are the things that one would expect from this software but it doesn't do them, or not correctly*

#### Spikes
When there is a discrepancy between the precision of vertices in the constrained TIN and the semantics (buildings) in some cases (where the semantics file polygon is rounded of to the inner side, compared to the building in the constrained TIN) a reflection on that wall will have a spike in the cross section, making the computed value incorrect for that cross section.

#### Noise sources
the noise level of a road source is computed using a default noise per meter, and an estimation of the segment length of the noise source. Therefore it does not take speed limit, cars per hour or other types of sources in consideration
