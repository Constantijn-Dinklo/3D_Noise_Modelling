*the abstract from your report*

*link to your report once it is uploaded to the TU Delft repository https://repository.tudelft.nl *

This repository is for the 3D Noise Modelling Synthesis Project of the course GEO1011 at the MSc Geomatics program at the Delft Unversity of Technology.

This project is part of the research on [automated reconstruction of 3D input data for noise studies](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/projects/noise3d/) at the 3D geoinformation research group of Delft Unversity of Technology.
